What to do

First go to the lab pc and work with that saved model. create test data or extract it from the RData file and trim the model out of the RData file and use carret to test the prediction. If worked. Save the trimmed model as RData file and export it here.

Then here,
in apply model.R:
put a load so you can load a model before the prediction part.
use prediction and return it
get rid of all the junk inputs
